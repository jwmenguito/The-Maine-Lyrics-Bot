I don't think I am capable of
This teenage televised taping of love.
***But here is my guide on how to be alone:
Just act like a freak and
Sleep with everyone you've ever known.
***I'm half crazy, all just cracked up
When will what I have ever be good enough?
***I'm sad, funny it seems lately this ain't a fairytale
And I don't think I'll ever be
Happy.
***And I'd like to think romance is real
Open my chest, a heart you could steal
***But here is my guide on how to stay alone
Just drink 'til you're gone and pass out on the floor
***And no I am not smiling
'Cause I don't think I'll ever be...
***Sophisticated mood swings
Manipulated day dreams
***We've got champagne taste
But not enough money for the real thing
We've got flames in our veins
And just enough money for the weekend
***Last night I did things my mother told me not to
With the people I shouldn't see
In the places that I should not go
***And It felt just like
Felt just like love and drugs
***Debilitated feelings sprawled across the bed
She's spinning perfect blue buildings
While I'm counting crows inside my head
***Let the waves of strange fall down
Let them crash and drift around
***You get what you pay for
Unless you take a little more
***What's the delay for?
Ain't nothing but a thunderstorm
***Find a new angle
You and me we'll start a war
Or you'll get what you paid for
***Take what you can carry
Joseph and Mary
They're out of town tonight
***Well you get what you pay for
The shiny things on silver screens
The media, celebrities
***What's the delay for?
Take what you want
Not what you need
Just take
And take and take
Take, take
***My children will be shining
Covered in diamonds
***If you see me don't put up a fight
Or you'll get what you paid for
Yeah you'll get what you paid for
***Here's to this breath
And the one I hope we take next
***It hurts to know
The hardest part
It hasn't come yet
***Oh please try to remind me just who you are
95', Just a child and his four white walls
Now that boy is a man
I don't know who I am
***I'm just a kid
Don't walk away
Please don't walk away
***I don't think I'll make it through today
If you walk away
Please don't walk away
***Here's to this love
We didn't earn, yet we're taking
To the same love
That's 30 years in the making
With a thousand more to come
***We bleed the same blood
You and me
***We bleed the same blood
The way that the river runs through
I bleed for you
***I wonder what you taste like
The salt within your skin
***Evil rages inside
Now I'm hungry for blood again
***The moon invites the madness
Brings out the worst in me
***Don't tell me this thing's loaded
Please don't tell me anything at all
***You put the gun in my hand
So now run
***I never meant to hurt anyone
I really thought that we were just having fun
***It's cheaper to be guilty
Than lie right through my teeth
***But god damn it kills me
More than you'll ever think
***How'd I become so ruthless?
Where is the other me?
***L.A., pick up the phone
I need to talk to you
Stop sleeping with my new friends
And all the old ones too
***Remember when we met?
I thought you thought I was boring
Then you called me on the phone
To arrange my birthday party
***Well this ain't a scripted movie
I don't drive a fancy car
Those flashing lights don't mean a thing to me
Goodbye, LA
***You showed me around the house
You took me by the wrist
Introduced me to your pals
The scientologists
***We cut the cake and sang
And I tried to fake a smile
And I drank and drank and drank
Because I felt so out of style
***Well this ain't my birthday party
No, It's just a fashion show
Yeah this is something it just isn't me
So long, L.A
***I do miss Hollywood
Enjoy the hazy city
***I'm sure you're feeling good
But soon enough you'll miss me
***I ain't got too much money
And nobody knows my name
But here is something I just have to say:
Fuck you, L.A
***My, my, my
What fangs you have
***Once upon a time
Your eyes were wide not dead
Then all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
***Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is red
***You should have warned me
You were blood red
Oh you're blood red baby
***It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless darling
***Once all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
Your blood, it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you're seeing is
Blood red
***What's it like
Living with your disease?
***Walk the streets at night
Looking like a well-dressed thief
***Oh this feels like the Kennedy Curse
And everything inside is dead
***I'm on the fence about what feels worse
The one leaving or the one in bed
***In a dream she's talking dirty to me
Just in a language that I can't speak
***Then she kisses my scars
As she cuts out my heart
And places it right on her sleeve
***I'm having visions of the way it will end
I can see it all now in my head
***You will cast the first stone
My sail will be torn
I'll lose my vessel to a dark sea bed
***Won't someone just come and take my heart
Set it down in front of moving cars
***I feel nothing at all
So won't someone just come and take my heart
And tear it apart
***Oh my thoughts they remain perverse
And I know I am the first of my kin
To be born with this curse
So persuade and coerce
Because I'm willing to be born again
***I lost her in 1978"
He tells me then looks away
It's simple he loved her so
A tenderness you can't let go
He said, "Son you don't forget your first true love
She won't forget you too"
***I only like the sad songs
(From the rock bands no one knows)
***No one gets me like the sad songs
(When I'm lost and I'm all alone)
***Just put the needle on the record
And if only for one second
It's enough
***Her father he arranged the marriage
And he gave away his daughters heart for goodness sake
What a shame, what a big mistake
A daughter's heart's not a good one to break
***So I said "Love, it has no age
Just wait; you'll find someone who will call you 'Baby'"
***You only like the sad songs?
Well here's a sad song for you, my love
***You say you like the sad songs
Here's a sad song for you, my love
For you, my love
***There's a crowd inside, free in spirit
Nothing dazzling in appearance
***We do the best with
With what we have
***We aren't models, we aren't actors
We are those who sit up in the rafters
***After all, that's where
You will find the action
***We're searching
For something
Just trying
To make it happen
***We listen
To no one
Don't forget we won't forgive
They'll write a story of the lives we lived
***Fucked up Kids
***There's a place for you and all my friends
When the sun falls down
A new day begins
Where feeling good is good enough
***Take a left on College Avenue
And call your friends they can all come too
They'll write a story of the lives we lived
Me, you
***I am alone
But I'm not lonely
***No, It's nothing personal
I prefer to do things on my own
***And even though nobody knows me
No I'm not lonely
No I'm raw, and invincible
***We are alone
But we're not lonely
No, It's nothing personal
We prefer to do things on our own
And even though nobody knows it
***I really should just go home
And play with myself
Better that than stay
And do something else
***Because we can't be friends
That much I know
I wish it wasn't so
And I can't take my heart some place it won't go
Show me to the door
***As if a plane crash were timely
There's no good time for bad news
***These four words don't come easy
I don't love you
***So listen to your friends and leave me alone
I'm just a boy, I'm drunk, I'm 24
***I don't want to hurt you anymore
Don't waste your tears on me, now pretty girl
***When I hate myself for letting you go
You can be the one to say I told you so
***Just this once
Just for now
You can be anything
In the world
***Darling don't
You start to scream
It doesn't mean anything
It's make believe
***Kids in costumes
Dressed like Kings and Queens
Little monsters
Walking down my street
***In this place
I'll be anything but me
So you be brave and
I'll still be eighteen
***Forever Halloween
***
I took a trip up the west coast
LAX to SFO
Was searching for a temp so low
And a summer high
***
The sun swayed and set slow
I made waves with some friends I know
I got lost in the ebb and flow
Of the drifting tide
***
I didn't ever want to come down
From that west coast rush and summer high
And easy, peaceful sense of time
I felt so alive
***
Now I'm alone when I'm back home
It's cold and old
But in my mind
I, I am
Miles and miles away
I'm miles away
***
Pretty pretty girls on two wheels
Dolores Heights and a laid-back feel
We sat and drank for a while until
The city came alive
***
We were smoking with strangers
We were dancing with the lights on
I was singing to "The Angels"
See that's my favorite X song
***
When the buzz ain't like it was
Well then it's time for a change
Just a subtle change
***
A tongue full of only tomorrow's
Will never quench your thirst for today
So what do you say we take a trip miles away?
***
Just take a trip miles away
***
Different tie
But I'm wearing the same suit
It's alright
'Cause the old can feel brand new
***
See, I feel so fresh
I feel so new
And I'm through with
With my miserable youth
***
All done up in my hand-me-down clothes
Shaking off the dust and assuming a pose
Well, these threads are so old
But they'll never know
No one will ever know
***
See, darlin' dear, you don't need high-priced designs
To feel dressed up, to feel dressed up to the nines
***
Different stride
But I'm wearing the same shoes
It's alright
'Cause the old can feel brand new
***
See, I feel so fresh and electric
And I feel so new and improved
And I'm through with
With my miserable
Oh that invisible youth
***
You don't need much of anything
To feel lush once in a while
No, you don't need much of anything
Just a strut and a little style
***
My hair
Is tired and it's falling out
But before it all does
I think I will let it all down
***
I'll grow it out
Like it's the sixties man
Because I feel young enough
And just because I can
***
Grow your hair out
Let your hair down
While you still can
Because it'll fall out
You'll go bald
Like an old man
***
Put the top down
Let your locks blow around
Driving through town without a care
Grow it to the ground, let it all down everywhere
Grow out your hair
***
The other morning as I rolled on out
Of my bed I got tripped up by something on the ground
My curls
Had grown all the way to the floor
I kinda like the way it looks
I'll grow it out some more
***
Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
Not my momma or a big wig millionaire
I'll let it all down anywhere
***
See I don't care
If you all care
It's on my head
And it's not your hair
***
Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
***
The girls are crying on the corner
'Cause the boys all left
And they've had too much to drink
***
We're in London, mid-October
He's convinced the blonde by the bar just gave him a wink
And the words he spoke left me in disbelief
***
He said, "Smoke whatever you've got left
It's getting late and we don't have much to lose"
Well, she said, "English girls, they just like sex"
I couldn't believe when he said, "I've got news for you
American boys do too
***
Her face went red as the words left his tongue and
She rolls up a cigarette and he strikes a paper match
I can tell he's pouring honey into her ear as
Us teenage kids were getting pissed on cider and black
***
He pins her against the wall
Tells her she's beautiful
She says she's going home
That's when he said…
***
And that boy, he is a drifter
Tomorrow he'll be far away
And the moment before he kissed her
***
24 floors
Up in some hotel room
Feeling so low
Thinking of jumping soon
***
I look up and see the stars
Look down at speeding cars
Think of my family
How they'll remember me
***
Eyes closed I see your face
I breathe deep and hesitate
I hear the words you'd say
If you were here with me
***
You don't wanna die tonight
Take one more breath to clear your mind
Every moment's relevant
Bittersweet and delicate
Tomorrow may not come again
***
24 floors
Up in some hotel room
Feeling so low
And some kind of muted blue
***
The TV talks at me
Apocalyptic-ally
Fosters the fear in me
But somehow I hear your plea
***
To be honest
I am full of shit
But that's alright
Because everyone else that I know is
It's just a tough thing
For us humans to admit
***
Yes, we all have the question
But we don't know what the answer is
The brain is a funny place
***
Oblivion is where I'm headed
My mind is on the brink of going supernova
Just shut up, that's when she said it
She told me just shut up and drink your diet soda
***
The bloody unknown
My every fear in essence
This neurotic head makes me believe
Danger is omnipresent
***
And all the crazies talk about
The world and how it's gonna end
I sit worried sick
Because I'm starting to believe them
And I've got an ugly little feeling
The brain is a funny place
***
I said
Between you and me, the psyche and the soma
My mind is on the brink of going supernova
***
I asked her what she thought of person vs. persona
She told me just shut up, your food is getting colder
Your words are getting older, just drink your diet soda
***
You think I'm ugly
Don't you?
And I know you hate my body
***
If you don't like just what I do
Do what you like
So maybe then you'll want me
Maybe then you'll want me
***
Am I pretty?
Do people like me yet?
***
Is there a party?
Am I invited?
***
It's such a pity
No one adores me yet
***
So make me up in a shade that fits me
Tell me love oh "Am I pretty?"
Oh am I pretty?
***
You make me feel like
Confetti for the gathering
***
So I'll get used to getting used
I'll do that for you
So maybe then you'll have me
Maybe then you'll have me
***
There's beauty and grace in the flaws of your face
All candor and style in the crook of your smile
***
I'm not looking for anything
In particular
But I'm far more desperate than you think
***
I wonder what it's like to be the universe
Experiencing itself ironically
***
I need some space to run around
I'll always have the underground
***
I'll build my road despite the cost
I'm not looking to be found
No, no not at all
***
Unaware of where I'm going
Or if I'm going anywhere at all
But I know I'll take the leap
If it is worth the fall
***
So long as the blood keeps flowing
I'll set a sail and swim across
***
I'm not looking to be found
Just want to feel unlost
***
With my eyes closed this feels like home
Adrift in my own head
***
And all I really know is
Whatever this is it doesn't get easier
So take it slow
Just take it slow
***
Between the silence and the sound
I'll never lose the underground
I'll build my road despite the cost
I'm not looking to be found
No, no not at all
***
The world is ours
But for a flash
And you are not allowed to be anybody else
***
Control what you can
Confront what you can't
And always remember how lucky you are to have yourself
***
Always remember how lucky you are to have yourself
***
What will you do on the weekends
When your best friends become your dead friends?
From all the sugar and all the sweetness
This little sweet tooth, it is your weakness
***
They've got American candy,
(You're sweet and sated, so sedated)
For the American kids,
(You're hooked and baited, annihilated)
***
And even if you wanted to
You couldn't stop, it's just so sweet
But this American candy
It'll rot your teeth
***
Try to think back to, back to a time when
You loved what you loved because you loved it
Before the sugar and all the sweetness
Filled up your lungs now, it's all you breath in
***
Sometimes I feel as though I'm going mad when
I get a touch of saccharine on my lips
***
I hate the taste on my tongue, too damn sweet
I don't fancy American candy, American candy
***
This one goes out to my closest friends
The ones who make me feel less alien
I do not think I would be here if not for them
***
See all the nights in shitty bars
Throwing up in taxi cars
Or on our backs under the stars
As we sang
***
What's another night on Mars?
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
***
The Earthlings crawl from bar to bar
Ignoring shooting stars
And grinding all the gears
***
The atmosphere here on Mars
Oh Lord it's quite bizarre
And will remain this way for years in years
***
Here's to now
And to nothing else
***
In a crowd
All by yourself
***
To the lows and every high
The hellos and the goodbyes
In this moment, I could die with you
***
Never felt like this before
Dizzy, drunk, and beautiful
In this moment, I let go with you
***
When you're next to me and the music's loud
Singing 'Hey Nineteen' somewhere in the crowd
***
We're up so high
They can't touch us now
***
We are thousands of feet from the ground
And won't come down
We won't come down
***
Yeah, here's to all
To all this culture's rules and your pretty things
How dirty, wild, blurry, juvenile
***
We ain't got no time for what tomorrow brings
And the choir sings
***
"I never wanna be a distraction"
You say as
You're unashamed and naked
I feel okay all over
Void of all composure
***
And I know this may sound narcissistic
I like the lips you kiss with
But I want to wear your lipstick
'Cause it means I got to kiss them
***
You say you like the sound of cigarettes after sex
And I say, “Yeah, yeah, yeah”
***
One, two hits
Her lips and bad behavior
I'm in danger
***
Three, four a.m
The feeling's getting stranger
I'm in danger
Bad behavior
***
And I don't have time for your feelings
You told me
You're insecure, but don't be
***
Stay soft, but don't be gentle
It's altogether mental
***
Let's go to a place where we can forget
We haven't left the room yet
You eloquently stated
Leaving's overrated
***
Oh, I inhale you in small doses
But adore you like the roses
***
You medicate me with your poses
I'm a lush, I know you notice
***
Oh, here we go again
Hope it don't lose its flavor
And I'm in danger
Yeah, I'm in danger
***
I think I know that you're bad for me
Oh, I know you're bad for me, yeah
***
What would you say if you could say
Everything you needed to
To the one, you needed to?
***
You flash like a setting sun
You come around, I come undone
Can't find the sound under my tongue
When I look at you
***
I lose my voice when I look at you
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to
Tell you all the right words
Waiting on the right words
***
Just another lovesick afternoon
Black butterflies and déjà vu
Hoping for the right words
Waiting for the right words
***
Just yesterday north of LA
I couldn't help but think of you
Every time I think of you
***
You crash like a rolling wave
You come around I lose my brain
Can't find the sound under my tongue
When I look at you
***
I've been searching for the right words
Right words, but I
I can't even find an echo
Don't you let go
***
There are only twenty
Six letters I can use
Just to tell you I won't let go
Don't you let go
***
In the backseat of the taxi
When you told me we were only
Two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind
***
And in the backseat when you asked me
"Is the sadness everlasting?"
I pulled you closer, looked at you and said
"Love, I think it is"
***
And it creeps on in
To the corners of yourself
Yeah, it creeps on in
Until it hurts like hell
***
And you know I never knew how much I was getting into
No, I never knew how much I was getting into
***
I can't say that I can make you feel
Complete or free from your worry
But believe me when I tell you
"Babe, you'll never be lonely"
***
You'll never be lonely
Don't you understand?
You won't be alone again
***
Do you remember
The other half of twenty three?
***
All lit up together
Full of guts and dopamine
Invincible, or so it seemed
***
Do you remember
The days we were golden
***
We would surrender
To just letting go
***
For worse or for better
Far from pretenders
We said forever
Forever ago
Do you remember?
***
Do you remember
Oh, the bayside
Out on Rockaway in June?
***
We’d leave the lonesome heat behind
For better weather
Sneaking out
And getting stoned
A time or two
Thought we were clever
But I know they knew
***
It hit me today
Wherever you are is just where you're at
Not where you'll always be
***
So wherever you are in the world
I want you to be there
And only there
***
Please know that life would be shit without you
I feel all sorts of good just thinking about you
***
I mean it when I say it
I genuinely hope you find whatever it is you're looking for
Even if you have to find it alone
***
Let's take our time
While it's still ours to take
***
'Cause some things hardly change
But nothing ever stays the same
***
Let's fall back in love
With the world and who we are
And do the things we talked about
But never did before
***
And darling
Don't blink because you will
And when you open up your eyes again
You may not recognise a friend
***
It may be bittersweet
'Cause we're no longer
Seventeen, but we're still young
So dance with me in naivety
And follow endlessly
The sound of reverie
***
Make up our minds
While they're still ours to make
***
The past is in the rear view
And the future holds no weight
***
We've got a lot
But what have we got to lose?
Besides the track of time
And all the ugly shades of blue
***
So forget the hearts and all the flowers
And we can share these clouds that I've been walking on
And focus on the trip we're on
***
Cause it's bittersweet
And don't you blink
Or you won't remember
***
It's tough to be anything these days
And tell me how much of right now is ours to take?
***
Some say the passing of time is bittersweet
But I think I love time the most when I'm with you
And it truly doesn't mean a thing
***
Don't you get lost in nostalgia, no
Turn something soft a little louder, yeah
***
Don't you get lost in nostalgia, no
It's not too late, it's not too late, no
***
Don't you get lost in nostalgia, no
Turn that little love a little louder yeah
***
The only thing I'm really sure of
I'm unsure of most everything
***
But I'm looking up and looking forward
There's nothing back there for you or me
***
Broken, beaten
***
Used and mistreated
***
Tired, shattered
***
Bruised and battered
***
You see, yesterday I said tomorrow
I learned today tomorrow can't be saved
***
So we speak in cursive
About the way it was
When days were young
But now the clock talks so loud
***
Articulate and perfect
About the way it is
And we ain't kids
The clock, it always talks so loud
***
And did you know?
I only wanna talk to you
***
I remember feeling weightless
In the deeper end
And drowning
In the fear again
***
And the lovely little loneliness
Would hold me down
Under the sound of being found
But then it all turned around
***
Dearly depressed and broken hearted
I'd like to let you know that boys cry too
***
Don't let them tell you how you're feeling
I wonder why nobody is asking you
***
Are you free or are you in sorrow?
Are you free or are you being borrowed?
***
How do you feel?
What's your condition?
You are alive but are you living?
***
Give me your voice and I'll give it a listen
Are you complete or is something missing?
***
So tell me
Do your hands shake?
Does your heart break?
When the earth quakes
***
Whatever it is
Whatever it isn't
Make sure that it's real
Oh, now, how do you feel?
***
To all the dearly depressed and broken hearted
The in-betweens and all the torn ones too
You're not alone in how you're feeling
I wonder why nobody is asking you
***
Break down, hysteric and young
***
Uncomfortably numb
Then you sent my pain into oblivion
***
I was on the verge of breaking down
Then you came around
And not a second too late
***
Well, give two fingers to the person that I used to be
You shook the noose, slipped my head loose
And now that boy is history
***
And you see that I knew better, yeah, I knew better
Than to refuse your hand, you rescued me from myself
***
Oh, just slip the noose
Untie the rope from my wrists
***
I was about to let go
'Til I knew you existed
***
Well, loneliness is hell and you're alone
But I can tell you that it's everything you need
Because it brought you back to me
***
To begin, I'm not sorry
For myself or any part of me
I won’t beg on your pardon, you see
***
You know I'm not a human
One part anxiety using two parts naivety
Just to keep sane
***
I'm a bitter little pill to swallow
I’m a little bit of let down
***
My feet are hard to follow
My best habit's lettin' you down
***
Am I makin' any sense? I don't know
***
I'm a little bit of let down, my
My feet are mine to follow
You don't get to decide
***
If you were waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
Cheap high, lullaby
Then my best habit’s letting you down
***
And if you’re searching for a sure thing, nice dream
Somethin' like a machine
Then my best habit’s letting you down
***
To you, I don't exist
Ain't what you're lookin’ for
***
Good thing I don't exist for you at all anymore
***
Now we're back to the matter
Well, if it's average you're after
Or ordinary, you'll have to move on
***
See, without me, I'm not myself
***
If I'm not me, then I am everyone else
***
If I'm not me, then I am everyone else
And then who would be John?
***
As a single tear falls to the ground
For the people that we are not now
***
If you're not you, you're everyone else
Who are you? Who are you now?
***
Burned our teenage years down to the ground
Oh, the hand on the clock's wearing out
***
Let's get this straight, you are
A panic in the bloodstream
Yet you bring me peace
***
You are
A stutter in the heart
That beats inside of me
***
You are my last, you are my first
***
You kill me for the better
***
You are the rising tide
***
You're every fuckin' thing inside me now
***
You are the violence in my veins
***
You are the war inside my brain
***
You are my glitter and my gloom
***
I am so numb without you
***
Let's get this straight, you are
A fever in the cold
Yet I'm not shivering
***
You are
A shudder in the voice
That screams inside of me
***
I won't leave, no, I won't surrender
Yeah, I'll wait 'til the end of, the end of time
***
With every single breath, oh, we're singing every line
***
For every beating chest, I will give my bleeding heart
***
I swear to every god, I feel everything tonight with you
***
When you're unwelcome in your skin, it's a symptom of the times
***
But there's nothin' left to lose, when there's nothin' left to hide
***
Feel it all over
***
All the pretty faces in love and wide awake
Tonight I feel so make-believe
***
Chances worth the taking just a touch away
Do you believe what you can't see?
***
With every single breath, oh, we're singing every line
For every beating chest, I will give my bleeding heart
I swear to every god, I feel everything tonight with you
***
When you're unwelcome in your skin, it's a symptom of the times
But there's nothin' left to lose, when there's nothin' left to hide
And I swear to every god, I feel everything tonight with you
***
We're standin' hand in hand, losing our cursed minds
Our backs against the wall
I feel it all, all over
***
We dance around the pain as the world breezes by
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it all over
***
Stars that sound so charming, dramatic, it's so true
We're made up of a thousand scars
***
So go and cry your heart out, this is what it says to do
Tomorrow's gone, tonight is ours
***
All around you now
Can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
***
All around you now
Feel it, feel it, feel it
***
Oh, can I feel your arms around me?
***
Blessed be the night we're breathin' in
Unforgettable and so benevolent
***
The closest that we'll get to Heaven-sent
For all us darling aliens
***
And we will never be this young again
So full of fire and rebellion
Now shoot the night just like it's medicine
And we all will be born again, again, again, again, again
***
This is everything you prayed for
This is everything I need
Please, don't anybody pray for me
***
My soul isn't yours to save anymore
***
Life is crazy, baby, don't forget the seatbelt
Adjust the rearview, crack the windows, shut the goddamn doors
Our great unknown, the open road
***
Blessed be the sky we're soaring in
So few of us and millions of them
***
Daylight isn't far away, my friend
And we all will be born again, again, again, again, again
***
So alive, we could die
As we drive all night in the afterlife
***
Through and through, by and by
Everything I love is right here tonight
***
Seven, Heaven, oh, it's clear
Heaven, we're already here
***
Let it live, let it die
No, we can't get off, here we are tonight
***
What you livin', what you livin', what you livin' for?
***
Is what you're livin' for worth dyin', worth dyin' for?
***
Never really, really ever felt so at home before
***
Never really ever felt this strange and beautiful
***
All us boys and all us girls
Turned to diamonds, turned to pearls
And never really, really ever felt so at home before
***
And I said, "I wanna feel like this forever"
Even if forever's just for now
***
We're on fire, let us burn
As the outside world, it turns
***
We are here and alive
In our corner of time
Forevermore
***
Forevermore
***
I never really, really ever felt so adored before
***
Never really ever felt this type of vulnerable
***
Don't have to hide, don't have to fear
All you have to be is here
And never really, really ever felt so adored before
***
Tell me what you think about
Lovers leaving this evening
(With the blood red moon)
***
Sex and freedom, shelter and
(Sweet endings, too)
***
Disappearing like a thought
(Our forbidden truth)
***
Disappear, never get caught
***
Dream with both eyes open
We can slip away
***
Our escape in motion
Now I'm wide awake
***
Save your tears for something
Worth crying over babe
***
Don’t waste them on misfortune
Darling, break away to a place they won't cry
Baby, they won't cry today
***
Just like a secret lovers’ suicide
Kiss off into the sky
To a mystic place where tears won't cry
***
We'll borrow happiness just for the night
Where all our tears won't cry
Oh and nothing can hurt you
***
Tell me what you think about
Me and you and Valentine
(And desire too)
***
Safe and sound in paradise
(Just me and you)
***
No sense in trying to hide
(Oh, it found me, too)
Our lust and our wild eyes
***
Just like a secret lovers' suicide
'Til death do us unite
In a mystic place where tears won't cry
***
As the sun takes the city
On the island of the rose
It's not London calling me
It's my heart back home
***
Oh, she waits for me in the rain outside
As I patiently try to pass the time
***
Oh, I had my fun in the smoke and clouds
But the day is done, now all I want is to get out 'cause it's been
***
Days, weeks, no light in this square mile
Her face, my mind, just one more twilight
***
One sunset left in England
So go on then, trouble
***
One sunset 'til I see her
In her red sundress
***
So I'll have a smoke and I'll fix a drink
Then I'll blow a kiss to the bloody queen
***
Oh, my love, she waits, so long overdue
One more sun to set, then I'll cross the sea to you
***
It's been two weeks in the rain
And it's hazy in my head
***
One more sunset in this place
'Til I see her again
***
Well, it isn’t getting easier
We are shattered everywhere
***
No, it isn’t getting easier now
But we’re not beyond repair
***
And we are brittle, beware
We crack, we tear
***
Handle with care
Half done entirely
***
We fall apart
Rebuild, restart
***
Right where we are
Found wanting everything
***
Fractured in fragments
Us fragile things
***
Falling to pieces
But we’re all the same broken parts
***
Fractions and halves of
Some greater thing
***
Fractured in fragments
Us fragile things
Falling to pieces
But we’re all the same broken
***
Fractions and halves of
Some greater thing
Falling to pieces
But we’re all the same broken parts
***
You can’t fall any further
Any further from the floor
***
So gather up yourself now, love
Just as you were before
***
You can’t fall any further
Any further from the floor
So gather up yourself now, love
Just as you were before
***
Feel the moment all around you
And the quiet that surrounds you
***
The time you have is sacred
Don't wait around and waste it
They can't take that away from you
***
Everything is temporary
Even the sorrow that you carry
***
So tell me are you okay?
You say you are okay
I'm okay now I'm with you
***
Cause you don't plan life, you live it
***
You don't take love, you give it
***
You can't change what is written
***
So when fate cries, you listen
***
And flowers on the grave
Of the child that I used to be
***
It was summer when you told me
That you loved me by the oak creek
***
My ears had never heard that
Tongue forgot the words and
Feet forgot the Earth, it's true
***
You don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
Yeah, and karma is calling over and over
***
You don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
So when fate cries, you listen
***
Everything is temporary
***
Flowers on the grave
Of the child that I used to be
***
I was on the verge of breaking down
Then you came around
