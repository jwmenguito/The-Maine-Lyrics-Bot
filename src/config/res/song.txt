I don't think I am capable of
This teenage televised taping of love.
***But here is my guide on how to be alone:
Just act like a freak and
Sleep with everyone you've ever known.
***I'm half crazy, all just cracked up
When will what I have ever be good enough?
***I'm sad, funny it seems lately this ain't a fairytale
And I don't think I'll ever be
Happy.
***And I'd like to think romance is real
Open my chest, a heart you could steal
***But here is my guide on how to stay alone
Just drink 'til you're gone and pass out on the floor
***And no I am not smiling
'Cause I don't think I'll ever be...
***Sophisticated mood swings
Manipulated day dreams
***We've got champagne taste
But not enough money for the real thing
We've got flames in our veins
And just enough money for the weekend
***Last night I did things my mother told me not to
With the people I shouldn't see
In the places that I should not go
***And It felt just like
Felt just like love and drugs
***Debilitated feelings sprawled across the bed
She's spinning perfect blue buildings
While I'm counting crows inside my head
***Let the waves of strange fall down
Let them crash and drift around
***You get what you pay for
Unless you take a little more
***What's the delay for?
Ain't nothing but a thunderstorm
***Find a new angle
You and me we'll start a war
Or you'll get what you paid for
***Take what you can carry
Joseph and Mary
They're out of town tonight
***Well you get what you pay for
The shiny things on silver screens
The media, celebrities
***What's the delay for?
Take what you want
Not what you need
Just take
And take and take
Take, take
***My children will be shining
Covered in diamonds
***If you see me don't put up a fight
Or you'll get what you paid for
Yeah you'll get what you paid for
***Here's to this breath
And the one I hope we take next
***It hurts to know
The hardest part
It hasn't come yet
***Oh please try to remind me just who you are
95', Just a child and his four white walls
Now that boy is a man
I don't know who I am
***I'm just a kid
Don't walk away
Please don't walk away
***I don't think I'll make it through today
If you walk away
Please don't walk away
***Here's to this love
We didn't earn, yet we're taking
To the same love
That's 30 years in the making
With a thousand more to come
***We bleed the same blood
You and me
***We bleed the same blood
The way that the river runs through
I bleed for you
***I wonder what you taste like
The salt within your skin
***Evil rages inside
Now I'm hungry for blood again
***The moon invites the madness
Brings out the worst in me
***Don't tell me this thing's loaded
Please don't tell me anything at all
***You put the gun in my hand
So now run
***I never meant to hurt anyone
I really thought that we were just having fun
***It's cheaper to be guilty
Than lie right through my teeth
***But god damn it kills me
More than you'll ever think
***How'd I become so ruthless?
Where is the other me?
***L.A., pick up the phone
I need to talk to you
Stop sleeping with my new friends
And all the old ones too
***Remember when we met?
I thought you thought I was boring
Then you called me on the phone
To arrange my birthday party
***Well this ain't a scripted movie
I don't drive a fancy car
Those flashing lights don't mean a thing to me
Goodbye, LA
***You showed me around the house
You took me by the wrist
Introduced me to your pals
The scientologists
***We cut the cake and sang
And I tried to fake a smile
And I drank and drank and drank
Because I felt so out of style
***Well this ain't my birthday party
No, It's just a fashion show
Yeah this is something it just isn't me
So long, L.A
***I do miss Hollywood
Enjoy the hazy city
***I'm sure you're feeling good
But soon enough you'll miss me
***I ain't got too much money
And nobody knows my name
But here is something I just have to say:
Fuck you, L.A
***My, my, my
What fangs you have
***Once upon a time
Your eyes were wide not dead
Then all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
***Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is red
***You should have warned me
You were blood red
Oh you're blood red baby
***It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless darling
***Once all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
Your blood, it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you're seeing is
Blood red
***What's it like
Living with your disease?
***Walk the streets at night
Looking like a well-dressed thief
***Oh this feels like the Kennedy Curse
And everything inside is dead
***I'm on the fence about what feels worse
The one leaving or the one in bed
***In a dream she's talking dirty to me
Just in a language that I can't speak
***Then she kisses my scars
As she cuts out my heart
And places it right on her sleeve
***I'm having visions of the way it will end
I can see it all now in my head
***You will cast the first stone
My sail will be torn
I'll lose my vessel to a dark sea bed
***Won't someone just come and take my heart
Set it down in front of moving cars
***I feel nothing at all
So won't someone just come and take my heart
And tear it apart
***Oh my thoughts they remain perverse
And I know I am the first of my kin
To be born with this curse
So persuade and coerce
Because I'm willing to be born again
***I lost her in 1978"
He tells me then looks away
It's simple he loved her so
A tenderness you can't let go
He said, "Son you don't forget your first true love
She won't forget you too"
***I only like the sad songs
(From the rock bands no one knows)
***No one gets me like the sad songs
(When I'm lost and I'm all alone)
***Just put the needle on the record
And if only for one second
It's enough
***Her father he arranged the marriage
And he gave away his daughters heart for goodness sake
What a shame, what a big mistake
A daughter's heart's not a good one to break
***So I said "Love, it has no age
Just wait; you'll find someone who will call you 'Baby'"
***You only like the sad songs?
Well here's a sad song for you, my love
***You say you like the sad songs
Here's a sad song for you, my love
For you, my love
***There's a crowd inside, free in spirit
Nothing dazzling in appearance
***We do the best with
With what we have
***We aren't models, we aren't actors
We are those who sit up in the rafters
***After all, that's where
You will find the action
***We're searching
For something
Just trying
To make it happen
***We listen
To no one
Don't forget we won't forgive
They'll write a story of the lives we lived
***Fucked up Kids
***There's a place for you and all my friends
When the sun falls down
A new day begins
Where feeling good is good enough
***Take a left on College Avenue
And call your friends they can all come too
They'll write a story of the lives we lived
Me, you
***I am alone
But I'm not lonely
***No, It's nothing personal
I prefer to do things on my own
***And even though nobody knows me
No I'm not lonely
No I'm raw, and invincible
***We are alone
But we're not lonely
No, It's nothing personal
We prefer to do things on our own
And even though nobody knows it
***I really should just go home
And play with myself
Better that than stay
And do something else
***Because we can't be friends
That much I know
I wish it wasn't so
And I can't take my heart some place it won't go
Show me to the door
***As if a plane crash were timely
There's no good time for bad news
***These four words don't come easy
I don't love you
***So listen to your friends and leave me alone
I'm just a boy, I'm drunk, I'm 24
***I don't want to hurt you anymore
Don't waste your tears on me, now pretty girl
***When I hate myself for letting you go
You can be the one to say I told you so
***Just this once
Just for now
You can be anything
In the world
***Darling don't
You start to scream
It doesn't mean anything
It's make believe
***Kids in costumes
Dressed like Kings and Queens
Little monsters
Walking down my street
***In this place
I'll be anything but me
So you be brave and
I'll still be eighteen
***Forever Halloween
