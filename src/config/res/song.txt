I don't think I am capable of
This teenage televised taping of love.
***But here is my guide on how to be alone:
Just act like a freak and
Sleep with everyone you've ever known.
***I'm half crazy, all just cracked up
When will what I have ever be good enough?
***I'm sad, funny it seems lately this ain't a fairytale
And I don't think I'll ever be
Happy.
***And I'd like to think romance is real
Open my chest, a heart you could steal
***But here is my guide on how to stay alone
Just drink 'til you're gone and pass out on the floor
***And no I am not smiling
'Cause I don't think I'll ever be...
***Sophisticated mood swings
Manipulated day dreams
***We've got champagne taste
But not enough money for the real thing
We've got flames in our veins
And just enough money for the weekend
***Last night I did things my mother told me not to
With the people I shouldn't see
In the places that I should not go
***And It felt just like
Felt just like love and drugs
***Debilitated feelings sprawled across the bed
She's spinning perfect blue buildings
While I'm counting crows inside my head
***Let the waves of strange fall down
Let them crash and drift around
***You get what you pay for
Unless you take a little more
***What's the delay for?
Ain't nothing but a thunderstorm
***Find a new angle
You and me we'll start a war
Or you'll get what you paid for
***Take what you can carry
Joseph and Mary
They're out of town tonight
***Well you get what you pay for
The shiny things on silver screens
The media, celebrities
***What's the delay for?
Take what you want
Not what you need
Just take
And take and take
Take, take
***My children will be shining
Covered in diamonds
***If you see me don't put up a fight
Or you'll get what you paid for
Yeah you'll get what you paid for
***Here's to this breath
And the one I hope we take next
***It hurts to know
The hardest part
It hasn't come yet
***Oh please try to remind me just who you are
95', Just a child and his four white walls
Now that boy is a man
I don't know who I am
***I'm just a kid
Don't walk away
Please don't walk away
***I don't think I'll make it through today
If you walk away
Please don't walk away
***Here's to this love
We didn't earn, yet we're taking
To the same love
That's 30 years in the making
With a thousand more to come
***We bleed the same blood
You and me
***We bleed the same blood
The way that the river runs through
I bleed for you
***I wonder what you taste like
The salt within your skin
***Evil rages inside
Now I'm hungry for blood again
***The moon invites the madness
Brings out the worst in me
***Don't tell me this thing's loaded
Please don't tell me anything at all
***You put the gun in my hand
So now run
***I never meant to hurt anyone
I really thought that we were just having fun
***It's cheaper to be guilty
Than lie right through my teeth
***But god damn it kills me
More than you'll ever think
***How'd I become so ruthless?
Where is the other me?
***L.A., pick up the phone
I need to talk to you
Stop sleeping with my new friends
And all the old ones too
***Remember when we met?
I thought you thought I was boring
Then you called me on the phone
To arrange my birthday party
***Well this ain't a scripted movie
I don't drive a fancy car
Those flashing lights don't mean a thing to me
Goodbye, LA
***You showed me around the house
You took me by the wrist
Introduced me to your pals
The scientologists
***We cut the cake and sang
And I tried to fake a smile
And I drank and drank and drank
Because I felt so out of style
***Well this ain't my birthday party
No, It's just a fashion show
Yeah this is something it just isn't me
So long, L.A
***I do miss Hollywood
Enjoy the hazy city
***I'm sure you're feeling good
But soon enough you'll miss me
***I ain't got too much money
And nobody knows my name
But here is something I just have to say:
Fuck you, L.A
***My, my, my
What fangs you have
***Once upon a time
Your eyes were wide not dead
Then all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
***Your blood it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you see is red
***You should have warned me
You were blood red
Oh you're blood red baby
***It came without warning
Now I'm wounded
You're so ruthless darling
***Once all the energy
Reversed the chemistry
Your blood, it mixed with all the chemicals in your head
Now all you're seeing is
Blood red
***What's it like
Living with your disease?
***Walk the streets at night
Looking like a well-dressed thief
***Oh this feels like the Kennedy Curse
And everything inside is dead
***I'm on the fence about what feels worse
The one leaving or the one in bed
***In a dream she's talking dirty to me
Just in a language that I can't speak
***Then she kisses my scars
As she cuts out my heart
And places it right on her sleeve
***I'm having visions of the way it will end
I can see it all now in my head
***You will cast the first stone
My sail will be torn
I'll lose my vessel to a dark sea bed
***Won't someone just come and take my heart
Set it down in front of moving cars
***I feel nothing at all
So won't someone just come and take my heart
And tear it apart
***Oh my thoughts they remain perverse
And I know I am the first of my kin
To be born with this curse
So persuade and coerce
Because I'm willing to be born again
***I lost her in 1978"
He tells me then looks away
It's simple he loved her so
A tenderness you can't let go
He said, "Son you don't forget your first true love
She won't forget you too"
***I only like the sad songs
(From the rock bands no one knows)
***No one gets me like the sad songs
(When I'm lost and I'm all alone)
***Just put the needle on the record
And if only for one second
It's enough
***Her father he arranged the marriage
And he gave away his daughters heart for goodness sake
What a shame, what a big mistake
A daughter's heart's not a good one to break
***So I said "Love, it has no age
Just wait; you'll find someone who will call you 'Baby'"
***You only like the sad songs?
Well here's a sad song for you, my love
***You say you like the sad songs
Here's a sad song for you, my love
For you, my love
***There's a crowd inside, free in spirit
Nothing dazzling in appearance
***We do the best with
With what we have
***We aren't models, we aren't actors
We are those who sit up in the rafters
***After all, that's where
You will find the action
***We're searching
For something
Just trying
To make it happen
***We listen
To no one
Don't forget we won't forgive
They'll write a story of the lives we lived
***Fucked up Kids
***There's a place for you and all my friends
When the sun falls down
A new day begins
Where feeling good is good enough
***Take a left on College Avenue
And call your friends they can all come too
They'll write a story of the lives we lived
Me, you
***I am alone
But I'm not lonely
***No, It's nothing personal
I prefer to do things on my own
***And even though nobody knows me
No I'm not lonely
No I'm raw, and invincible
***We are alone
But we're not lonely
No, It's nothing personal
We prefer to do things on our own
And even though nobody knows it
***I really should just go home
And play with myself
Better that than stay
And do something else
***Because we can't be friends
That much I know
I wish it wasn't so
And I can't take my heart some place it won't go
Show me to the door
***As if a plane crash were timely
There's no good time for bad news
***These four words don't come easy
I don't love you
***So listen to your friends and leave me alone
I'm just a boy, I'm drunk, I'm 24
***I don't want to hurt you anymore
Don't waste your tears on me, now pretty girl
***When I hate myself for letting you go
You can be the one to say I told you so
***Just this once
Just for now
You can be anything
In the world
***Darling don't
You start to scream
It doesn't mean anything
It's make believe
***Kids in costumes
Dressed like Kings and Queens
Little monsters
Walking down my street
***In this place
I'll be anything but me
So you be brave and
I'll still be eighteen
***Forever Halloween
***
I took a trip up the west coast
LAX to SFO
Was searching for a temp so low
And a summer high
***
The sun swayed and set slow
I made waves with some friends I know
I got lost in the ebb and flow
Of the drifting tide
***
I didn't ever want to come down
From that west coast rush and summer high
And easy, peaceful sense of time
I felt so alive
***
Now I'm alone when I'm back home
It's cold and old
But in my mind
I, I am
Miles and miles away
I'm miles away
***
Pretty pretty girls on two wheels
Dolores Heights and a laid-back feel
We sat and drank for a while until
The city came alive
***
We were smoking with strangers
We were dancing with the lights on
I was singing to "The Angels"
See that's my favorite X song
***
When the buzz ain't like it was
Well then it's time for a change
Just a subtle change
***
A tongue full of only tomorrow's
Will never quench your thirst for today
So what do you say we take a trip miles away?
***
Just take a trip miles away
***
Different tie
But I'm wearing the same suit
It's alright
'Cause the old can feel brand new
***
See, I feel so fresh
I feel so new
And I'm through with
With my miserable youth
***
All done up in my hand-me-down clothes
Shaking off the dust and assuming a pose
Well, these threads are so old
But they'll never know
No one will ever know
***
See, darlin' dear, you don't need high-priced designs
To feel dressed up, to feel dressed up to the nines
***
Different stride
But I'm wearing the same shoes
It's alright
'Cause the old can feel brand new
***
See, I feel so fresh and electric
And I feel so new and improved
And I'm through with
With my miserable
Oh that invisible youth
***
You don't need much of anything
To feel lush once in a while
No, you don't need much of anything
Just a strut and a little style
***
My hair
Is tired and it's falling out
But before it all does
I think I will let it all down
***
I'll grow it out
Like it's the sixties man
Because I feel young enough
And just because I can
***
Grow your hair out
Let your hair down
While you still can
Because it'll fall out
You'll go bald
Like an old man
***
Put the top down
Let your locks blow around
Driving through town without a care
Grow it to the ground, let it all down everywhere
Grow out your hair
***
The other morning as I rolled on out
Of my bed I got tripped up by something on the ground
My curls
Had grown all the way to the floor
I kinda like the way it looks
I'll grow it out some more
***
Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
Not my momma or a big wig millionaire
I'll let it all down anywhere
***
See I don't care
If you all care
It's on my head
And it's not your hair
***
Nobody's gonna tell me how to wear my hair
***
The girls are crying on the corner
'Cause the boys all left
And they've had too much to drink
***
We're in London, mid-October
He's convinced the blonde by the bar just gave him a wink
And the words he spoke left me in disbelief
***
He said, "Smoke whatever you've got left
It's getting late and we don't have much to lose"
Well, she said, "English girls, they just like sex"
I couldn't believe when he said, "I've got news for you
American boys do too
***
Her face went red as the words left his tongue and
She rolls up a cigarette and he strikes a paper match
I can tell he's pouring honey into her ear as
Us teenage kids were getting pissed on cider and black
***
He pins her against the wall
Tells her she's beautiful
She says she's going home
That's when he said…
***
And that boy, he is a drifter
Tomorrow he'll be far away
And the moment before he kissed her
***
24 floors
Up in some hotel room
Feeling so low
Thinking of jumping soon
***
I look up and see the stars
Look down at speeding cars
Think of my family
How they'll remember me
***
Eyes closed I see your face
I breathe deep and hesitate
I hear the words you'd say
If you were here with me
***
You don't wanna die tonight
Take one more breath to clear your mind
Every moment's relevant
Bittersweet and delicate
Tomorrow may not come again
***
24 floors
Up in some hotel room
Feeling so low
And some kind of muted blue
***
The TV talks at me
Apocalyptic-ally
Fosters the fear in me
But somehow I hear your plea
***
To be honest
I am full of shit
But that's alright
Because everyone else that I know is
It's just a tough thing
For us humans to admit
***
Yes, we all have the question
But we don't know what the answer is
The brain is a funny place
***
Oblivion is where I'm headed
My mind is on the brink of going supernova
Just shut up, that's when she said it
She told me just shut up and drink your diet soda
***
The bloody unknown
My every fear in essence
This neurotic head makes me believe
Danger is omnipresent
***
And all the crazies talk about
The world and how it's gonna end
I sit worried sick
Because I'm starting to believe them
And I've got an ugly little feeling
The brain is a funny place
***
I said
Between you and me, the psyche and the soma
My mind is on the brink of going supernova
***
I asked her what she thought of person vs. persona
She told me just shut up, your food is getting colder
Your words are getting older, just drink your diet soda
***
You think I'm ugly
Don't you?
And I know you hate my body
***
If you don't like just what I do
Do what you like
So maybe then you'll want me
Maybe then you'll want me
***
Am I pretty?
Do people like me yet?
***
Is there a party?
Am I invited?
***
It's such a pity
No one adores me yet
***
So make me up in a shade that fits me
Tell me love oh "Am I pretty?"
Oh am I pretty?
***
You make me feel like
Confetti for the gathering
***
So I'll get used to getting used
I'll do that for you
So maybe then you'll have me
Maybe then you'll have me
***
There's beauty and grace in the flaws of your face
All candor and style in the crook of your smile
***
I'm not looking for anything
In particular
But I'm far more desperate than you think
***
I wonder what it's like to be the universe
Experiencing itself ironically
***
I need some space to run around
I'll always have the underground
***
I'll build my road despite the cost
I'm not looking to be found
No, no not at all
***
Unaware of where I'm going
Or if I'm going anywhere at all
But I know I'll take the leap
If it is worth the fall
***
So long as the blood keeps flowing
I'll set a sail and swim across
***
I'm not looking to be found
Just want to feel unlost
***
With my eyes closed this feels like home
Adrift in my own head
***
And all I really know is
Whatever this is it doesn't get easier
So take it slow
Just take it slow
***
Between the silence and the sound
I'll never lose the underground
I'll build my road despite the cost
I'm not looking to be found
No, no not at all
***
The world is ours
But for a flash
And you are not allowed to be anybody else
***
Control what you can
Confront what you can't
And always remember how lucky you are to have yourself
***
Always remember how lucky you are to have yourself
***
What will you do on the weekends
When your best friends become your dead friends?
From all the sugar and all the sweetness
This little sweet tooth, it is your weakness
***
They've got American candy,
(You're sweet and sated, so sedated)
For the American kids,
(You're hooked and baited, annihilated)
***
And even if you wanted to
You couldn't stop, it's just so sweet
But this American candy
It'll rot your teeth
***
Try to think back to, back to a time when
You loved what you loved because you loved it
Before the sugar and all the sweetness
Filled up your lungs now, it's all you breath in
***
Sometimes I feel as though I'm going mad when
I get a touch of saccharine on my lips
***
I hate the taste on my tongue, too damn sweet
I don't fancy American candy, American candy
***
This one goes out to my closest friends
The ones who make me feel less alien
I do not think I would be here if not for them
***
See all the nights in shitty bars
Throwing up in taxi cars
Or on our backs under the stars
As we sang
***
What's another night on Mars?
With friends like ours
Anywhere is home
***
The Earthlings crawl from bar to bar
Ignoring shooting stars
And grinding all the gears
***
The atmosphere here on Mars
Oh Lord it's quite bizarre
And will remain this way for years in years
***
Here's to now
And to nothing else
***
In a crowd
All by yourself
***
To the lows and every high
The hellos and the goodbyes
In this moment, I could die with you
***
Never felt like this before
Dizzy, drunk, and beautiful
In this moment, I let go with you
***
When you're next to me and the music's loud
Singing 'Hey Nineteen' somewhere in the crowd
***
We're up so high
They can't touch us now
***
We are thousands of feet from the ground
And won't come down
We won't come down
***
Yeah, here's to all
To all this culture's rules and your pretty things
How dirty, wild, blurry, juvenile
***
We ain't got no time for what tomorrow brings
And the choir sings
***
"I never wanna be a distraction"
You say as
You're unashamed and naked
I feel okay all over
Void of all composure
***
And I know this may sound narcissistic
I like the lips you kiss with
But I want to wear your lipstick
'Cause it means I got to kiss them
***
You say you like the sound of cigarettes after sex
And I say, “Yeah, yeah, yeah”
***
One, two hits
Her lips and bad behavior
I'm in danger
***
Three, four a.m
The feeling's getting stranger
I'm in danger
Bad behavior
***
And I don't have time for your feelings
You told me
You're insecure, but don't be
***
Stay soft, but don't be gentle
It's altogether mental
***
Let's go to a place where we can forget
We haven't left the room yet
You eloquently stated
Leaving's overrated
***
Oh, I inhale you in small doses
But adore you like the roses
***
You medicate me with your poses
I'm a lush, I know you notice
***
Oh, here we go again
Hope it don't lose its flavor
And I'm in danger
Yeah, I'm in danger
***
I think I know that you're bad for me
Oh, I know you're bad for me, yeah
***
What would you say if you could say
Everything you needed to
To the one, you needed to?
***
You flash like a setting sun
You come around, I come undone
Can't find the sound under my tongue
When I look at you
***
I lose my voice when I look at you
Can't make a noise though I'm trying to
Tell you all the right words
Waiting on the right words
***
Just another lovesick afternoon
Black butterflies and déjà vu
Hoping for the right words
Waiting for the right words
***
Just yesterday north of LA
I couldn't help but think of you
Every time I think of you
***
You crash like a rolling wave
You come around I lose my brain
Can't find the sound under my tongue
When I look at you
***
I've been searching for the right words
Right words, but I
I can't even find an echo
Don't you let go
***
There are only twenty
Six letters I can use
Just to tell you I won't let go
Don't you let go
***
In the backseat of the taxi
When you told me we were only
Two punch-drunk souls all tangled in the wind
***
And in the backseat when you asked me
"Is the sadness everlasting?"
I pulled you closer, looked at you and said
"Love, I think it is"
***
And it creeps on in
To the corners of yourself
Yeah, it creeps on in
Until it hurts like hell
***
And you know I never knew how much I was getting into
No, I never knew how much I was getting into
***
I can't say that I can make you feel
Complete or free from your worry
But believe me when I tell you
"Babe, you'll never be lonely"
***
You'll never be lonely
Don't you understand?
You won't be alone again
***
Do you remember
The other half of twenty three?
***
All lit up together
Full of guts and dopamine
Invincible, or so it seemed
***
Do you remember
The days we were golden
***
We would surrender
To just letting go
***
For worse or for better
Far from pretenders
We said forever
Forever ago
Do you remember?
***
Do you remember
Oh, the bayside
Out on Rockaway in June?
***
We’d leave the lonesome heat behind
For better weather
Sneaking out
And getting stoned
A time or two
Thought we were clever
But I know they knew
***
It hit me today
Wherever you are is just where you're at
Not where you'll always be
***
So wherever you are in the world
I want you to be there
And only there
***
Please know that life would be shit without you
I feel all sorts of good just thinking about you
***
I mean it when I say it
I genuinely hope you find whatever it is you're looking for
Even if you have to find it alone
***
Let's take our time
While it's still ours to take
***
'Cause some things hardly change
But nothing ever stays the same
***
Let's fall back in love
With the world and who we are
And do the things we talked about
But never did before
***
And darling
Don't blink because you will
And when you open up your eyes again
You may not recognise a friend
***
It may be bittersweet
'Cause we're no longer
Seventeen, but we're still young
So dance with me in naivety
And follow endlessly
The sound of reverie
***
Make up our minds
While they're still ours to make
***
The past is in the rear view
And the future holds no weight
***
We've got a lot
But what have we got to lose?
Besides the track of time
And all the ugly shades of blue
***
So forget the hearts and all the flowers
And we can share these clouds that I've been walking on
And focus on the trip we're on
***
Cause it's bittersweet
And don't you blink
Or you won't remember
***
It's tough to be anything these days
And tell me how much of right now is ours to take?
***
Some say the passing of time is bittersweet
But I think I love time the most when I'm with you
And it truly doesn't mean a thing
***
Don't you get lost in nostalgia, no
Turn something soft a little louder, yeah
***
Don't you get lost in nostalgia, no
It's not too late, it's not too late, no
***
Don't you get lost in nostalgia, no
Turn that little love a little louder yeah
***
The only thing I'm really sure of
I'm unsure of most everything
***
But I'm looking up and looking forward
There's nothing back there for you or me
***
Broken, beaten
***
Used and mistreated
***
Tired, shattered
***
Bruised and battered
***
You see, yesterday I said tomorrow
I learned today tomorrow can't be saved
***
So we speak in cursive
About the way it was
When days were young
But now the clock talks so loud
***
Articulate and perfect
About the way it is
And we ain't kids
The clock, it always talks so loud
***
And did you know?
I only wanna talk to you
***
I remember feeling weightless
In the deeper end
And drowning
In the fear again
***
And the lovely little loneliness
Would hold me down
Under the sound of being found
But then it all turned around
***
Dearly depressed and broken hearted
I'd like to let you know that boys cry too
***
Don't let them tell you how you're feeling
I wonder why nobody is asking you
***
Are you free or are you in sorrow?
Are you free or are you being borrowed?
***
How do you feel?
What's your condition?
You are alive but are you living?
***
Give me your voice and I'll give it a listen
Are you complete or is something missing?
***
So tell me
Do your hands shake?
Does your heart break?
When the earth quakes
***
Whatever it is
Whatever it isn't
Make sure that it's real
Oh, now, how do you feel?
***
To all the dearly depressed and broken hearted
The in-betweens and all the torn ones too
You're not alone in how you're feeling
I wonder why nobody is asking you
***
Break down, hysteric and young
***
Uncomfortably numb
Then you sent my pain into oblivion
***
I was on the verge of breaking down
Then you came around
And not a second too late
***
Well, give two fingers to the person that I used to be
You shook the noose, slipped my head loose
And now that boy is history
***
And you see that I knew better, yeah, I knew better
Than to refuse your hand, you rescued me from myself
***
Oh, just slip the noose
Untie the rope from my wrists
***
I was about to let go
'Til I knew you existed
***
Well, loneliness is hell and you're alone
But I can tell you that it's everything you need
Because it brought you back to me
***
To begin, I'm not sorry
For myself or any part of me
I won’t beg on your pardon, you see
***
You know I'm not a human
One part anxiety using two parts naivety
Just to keep sane
***
I'm a bitter little pill to swallow
I’m a little bit of let down
***
My feet are hard to follow
My best habit's lettin' you down
***
Am I makin' any sense? I don't know
***
I'm a little bit of let down, my
My feet are mine to follow
You don't get to decide
***
If you were waitin' on the sunshine, blue sky
Cheap high, lullaby
Then my best habit’s letting you down
***
And if you’re searching for a sure thing, nice dream
Somethin' like a machine
Then my best habit’s letting you down
***
To you, I don't exist
Ain't what you're lookin’ for
***
Good thing I don't exist for you at all anymore
***
Now we're back to the matter
Well, if it's average you're after
Or ordinary, you'll have to move on
***
See, without me, I'm not myself
***
If I'm not me, then I am everyone else
***
If I'm not me, then I am everyone else
And then who would be John?
***
As a single tear falls to the ground
For the people that we are not now
***
If you're not you, you're everyone else
Who are you? Who are you now?
***
Burned our teenage years down to the ground
Oh, the hand on the clock's wearing out
***
Let's get this straight, you are
A panic in the bloodstream
Yet you bring me peace
***
You are
A stutter in the heart
That beats inside of me
***
You are my last, you are my first
***
You kill me for the better
***
You are the rising tide
***
You're every fuckin' thing inside me now
***
You are the violence in my veins
***
You are the war inside my brain
***
You are my glitter and my gloom
***
I am so numb without you
***
Let's get this straight, you are
A fever in the cold
Yet I'm not shivering
***
You are
A shudder in the voice
That screams inside of me
***
I won't leave, no, I won't surrender
Yeah, I'll wait 'til the end of, the end of time
***
With every single breath, oh, we're singing every line
***
For every beating chest, I will give my bleeding heart
***
I swear to every god, I feel everything tonight with you
***
When you're unwelcome in your skin, it's a symptom of the times
***
But there's nothin' left to lose, when there's nothin' left to hide
***
Feel it all over
***
All the pretty faces in love and wide awake
Tonight I feel so make-believe
***
Chances worth the taking just a touch away
Do you believe what you can't see?
***
With every single breath, oh, we're singing every line
For every beating chest, I will give my bleeding heart
I swear to every god, I feel everything tonight with you
***
When you're unwelcome in your skin, it's a symptom of the times
But there's nothin' left to lose, when there's nothin' left to hide
And I swear to every god, I feel everything tonight with you
***
We're standin' hand in hand, losing our cursed minds
Our backs against the wall
I feel it all, all over
***
We dance around the pain as the world breezes by
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it all over
***
Stars that sound so charming, dramatic, it's so true
We're made up of a thousand scars
***
So go and cry your heart out, this is what it says to do
Tomorrow's gone, tonight is ours
***
All around you now
Can you feel it?
Tell me, can you feel it?
***
All around you now
Feel it, feel it, feel it
***
Oh, can I feel your arms around me?
***
Blessed be the night we're breathin' in
Unforgettable and so benevolent
***
The closest that we'll get to Heaven-sent
For all us darling aliens
***
And we will never be this young again
So full of fire and rebellion
Now shoot the night just like it's medicine
And we all will be born again, again, again, again, again
***
This is everything you prayed for
This is everything I need
Please, don't anybody pray for me
***
My soul isn't yours to save anymore
***
Life is crazy, baby, don't forget the seatbelt
Adjust the rearview, crack the windows, shut the goddamn doors
Our great unknown, the open road
***
Blessed be the sky we're soaring in
So few of us and millions of them
***
Daylight isn't far away, my friend
And we all will be born again, again, again, again, again
***
So alive, we could die
As we drive all night in the afterlife
***
Through and through, by and by
Everything I love is right here tonight
***
Seven, Heaven, oh, it's clear
Heaven, we're already here
***
Let it live, let it die
No, we can't get off, here we are tonight
***
What you livin', what you livin', what you livin' for?
***
Is what you're livin' for worth dyin', worth dyin' for?
***
Never really, really ever felt so at home before
***
Never really ever felt this strange and beautiful
***
All us boys and all us girls
Turned to diamonds, turned to pearls
And never really, really ever felt so at home before
***
And I said, "I wanna feel like this forever"
Even if forever's just for now
***
We're on fire, let us burn
As the outside world, it turns
***
We are here and alive
In our corner of time
Forevermore
***
Forevermore
***
I never really, really ever felt so adored before
***
Never really ever felt this type of vulnerable
***
Don't have to hide, don't have to fear
All you have to be is here
And never really, really ever felt so adored before
***
Tell me what you think about
Lovers leaving this evening
(With the blood red moon)
***
Sex and freedom, shelter and
(Sweet endings, too)
***
Disappearing like a thought
(Our forbidden truth)
***
Disappear, never get caught
***
Dream with both eyes open
We can slip away
***
Our escape in motion
Now I'm wide awake
***
Save your tears for something
Worth crying over babe
***
Don’t waste them on misfortune
Darling, break away to a place they won't cry
Baby, they won't cry today
***
Just like a secret lovers’ suicide
Kiss off into the sky
To a mystic place where tears won't cry
***
We'll borrow happiness just for the night
Where all our tears won't cry
Oh and nothing can hurt you
***
Tell me what you think about
Me and you and Valentine
(And desire too)
***
Safe and sound in paradise
(Just me and you)
***
No sense in trying to hide
(Oh, it found me, too)
Our lust and our wild eyes
***
Just like a secret lovers' suicide
'Til death do us unite
In a mystic place where tears won't cry
***
As the sun takes the city
On the island of the rose
It's not London calling me
It's my heart back home
***
Oh, she waits for me in the rain outside
As I patiently try to pass the time
***
Oh, I had my fun in the smoke and clouds
But the day is done, now all I want is to get out 'cause it's been
***
Days, weeks, no light in this square mile
Her face, my mind, just one more twilight
***
One sunset left in England
So go on then, trouble
***
One sunset 'til I see her
In her red sundress
***
So I'll have a smoke and I'll fix a drink
Then I'll blow a kiss to the bloody queen
***
Oh, my love, she waits, so long overdue
One more sun to set, then I'll cross the sea to you
***
It's been two weeks in the rain
And it's hazy in my head
***
One more sunset in this place
'Til I see her again
***
Well, it isn’t getting easier
We are shattered everywhere
***
No, it isn’t getting easier now
But we’re not beyond repair
***
And we are brittle, beware
We crack, we tear
***
Handle with care
Half done entirely
***
We fall apart
Rebuild, restart
***
Right where we are
Found wanting everything
***
Fractured in fragments
Us fragile things
***
Falling to pieces
But we’re all the same broken parts
***
Fractions and halves of
Some greater thing
***
Fractured in fragments
Us fragile things
Falling to pieces
But we’re all the same broken
***
Fractions and halves of
Some greater thing
Falling to pieces
But we’re all the same broken parts
***
You can’t fall any further
Any further from the floor
***
So gather up yourself now, love
Just as you were before
***
You can’t fall any further
Any further from the floor
So gather up yourself now, love
Just as you were before
***
Feel the moment all around you
And the quiet that surrounds you
***
The time you have is sacred
Don't wait around and waste it
They can't take that away from you
***
Everything is temporary
Even the sorrow that you carry
***
So tell me are you okay?
You say you are okay
I'm okay now I'm with you
***
Cause you don't plan life, you live it
***
You don't take love, you give it
***
You can't change what is written
***
So when fate cries, you listen
***
And flowers on the grave
Of the child that I used to be
***
It was summer when you told me
That you loved me by the oak creek
***
My ears had never heard that
Tongue forgot the words and
Feet forgot the Earth, it's true
***
You don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
Yeah, and karma is calling over and over
***
You don't plan life, you live it
You don't take love, you give it
You can't change what is written
So when fate cries, you listen
***
Everything is temporary
***
Flowers on the grave
Of the child that I used to be
***
I was on the verge of breaking down
Then you came around
***
Some things are out of my hands
I'm what time and consequence have made me
***
Sit back and watch the world explode
3, 2, 1 here come the fireworks baby
***
Sometimes you can feel so smart
Just like a ghost in school clothes
***
But my days are mostly hazy
3, 2, 1 here comes the hurricane baby
***
Identify
***
If I am not a man, what am I then?
***
My head, my hands are all I really have
***
Don't stand in line, identify
***
I bought the last plane ticket to the end of the world
***
Who ever says that the good die young?
All the boys are alive
All the boys are with girls
Time to give them what they're waiting for
***
If the drugs don't work then you probably need more
***
I'm the 88 snake that you love to hate
***
My tongue, my teeth are what you're going to taste
***
Don't stand in line
No don't stand in line
Identify
***
Some things are out of my hands
***
I'm feeling pretty dirty baby
Forgive my sins
***
I get the feeling you can save me honey
My heroine
***
Your hips, 
my hands, 
you swing 
and you dance
***
Yea, I'm feeling pretty lonely baby
Just let me in
***
You're my heroine, just suicide
If I let you in you crawl inside
***
Oh you save my skin
She can't wait to sink in
My heroine
***
I feel a little withdrawal baby
Come pick me up
***
Took a hit from your level
Now I just can't get enough
***
Your taste, my touch
A little bit of love and a whole lot of lust
***
Well, I'm trapped in this human body
Yes, I'm trapped
I got no place else to go
***
And I can't even help my brothers
'Cause there's still so much I don't know
***
I just need some time to figure out
***
Time to figure out
Time to figure this thing out
***
I just need some time
***
Well, I'm trapped in this modern city
Yes, I'm trapped with this fancy drugs
***
And I can't even please my mother
'Cause there's still so much that she don't know
***
Well, this can't be all for nothing
But this time is all the time I get
***
I could use some time to figure out
Just a little time
***
Time to figure out
It's all I need
***
Some days feel alone
On your own like a rolling stone
A perfect waste of a perfect day
***
Some days feel like chores
You get more than you bargain for
A heavy plate for one to undertake
***
I hate to say I told you so
But I just thought I'd let you know
***
Some days, they taste like lemonade
Some days can feel like razorblades
***
I wish I could float away, some days
***
Some days smell like spring
Birds, they sing, jasmine's blossoming
Everything, oh it's everything
***
Some times things can seem evergreen
Like the TV screen
Reality, it's reality
***
Float away, I wish I could float away
***
I hate to say I told you so
***
I'm fucked up again
I shouldn't drive tonight, but
I keep thinking of you
***
I hurt you again
I shouldn't lie tonight
So the next few words are true
***
Never again, never again, no
Will I leave you high and
Never again, never again, no
***
Never again, never again, no
Will I leave you high and dry
This time, I more than mean it
***
I'm sorry, I'm not what you wanted
***
I'm sorry, I'm sorry I let you down
***
I could use some poor excuse
Cause the hardest thing to say
***
It's the hardest thing to say in the world
I'm sorry,
Yeah I'm sorry
***
Yeah I'm messed up again
Thinking about the times
I was lost and you let me in
***
And I'm only human, both you and
I know the way this will end
***
I am weakness, I am greatness
I'm anything, you want me to be
***
I am wasted, and I'll make this
The anthem for a dying breed
***
See the light in the night when you're fading away
***
Trust in us, we're all that you've got these days
***
Take a look inside my heart
Oh, lets get carried away
***
Don't you dare, don't you ever give up
Don't you ever give up
***
Don't you dare, don't you ever give up
Don't you ever give up on us, my dear
***
I am selfless, I am selfish
I'm anything, that I want to be
***
This is violent, this is honest
It's the anthem for a dying breed
***
I’ll say this once again
You people, you are my friends
***
The devil, he can’t come in
Tonight, that’s right
***
Looking for misery, but she found me
Lying naked on the floor
***
I was headed insane, 
the devil told me his name
But he’s not welcome here, anymore
***
Tell me what do you see
When you’re looking at me?
***
This sense of responsibility is killing me inside
***
Stay away, sweet misery
***
The pressure’s building with time
I made it up in my mind
***
I’ve got excuses for all these things that I tried in my life
***
I will collapse
So lets make this moment last
I am alone
No, not because I'm lost
Because I'm found
***
And I like the way it sounds when I'm at home
Don't say that I can't do it on my own
***
Then you did collide
And broke through the other side 
Straight to my heart
***
You're the ember to my flame when it gets dark
***
And I love the way it feels when I'm with you
And I cannot find the words, no
***
Two-hundred thirty places to my place
Oh, I should not be alone
***
I'll burn this house down
No need for walls now
***
When I'm with you, I'm at home
***
Went outside and saw the moon
And it made me think of you
***
Then the rain it came and came
There you were inside my brain
***
I've been thinking of you
***
Driving in my car
(I heard the radio)
Play that Dylan song
("The Times They Are-A Changing")
But you still haven't changed your mind
So I sat and sang along
I was singing along
***
'Cause you're in my head
And I can't take it
I need you by my side
***
So I'll take the ten 
And I'll drive till dawn
To show you I'm the one
***
Before I go
Please know I'm trying
Trying to be a better man
***
Before I leave
Please don't get angry
Just dry your eyes and take my hand
***
I'll make this right
Oh, I will try
***
Jenny don't you cry
Close your eyes
Everything is going to be alright
You're so young and still so free
***
Jenny take my hand
Understand
I will try to be a better man
Without you there is no me
***
There is a boy inside me running
From a man I've yet to meet
I see his face it only scares me
I hope things change eventually
***
Tell me how to feel like we did when we were young
***
Oh, you would take the wheel
Oh yeah we were on the run
***
And I remember nights
We would sing 'till we saw the sun
***
Oh, just tell me how to feel like we did
When we we're young
So young
***
Yeah, you were dancing to your favorite song
And all my friends, oh they were singing along
***
We got down, we got high
Oh, the moment felt so right
***
So let's run free and carry on
Like we did when we were young
***
We turn the music loud
When we drive right through the town
***
But we roll the windows down
So the cops won't come around
***
Take me to the time
When things were fine, it's all broken now
***
But always keep in mind, things are fine
And we'll figure it out
***
Turn it up, it's my song
I can't sing, but I'll sing along
***
Yeah, I can feel it in my bones
A little rock, a little roll
***
Take it fast, take it slow
Let me tell you something that you don't know
***
Well the bars are all closed
And we got no place to go
But we're all a little drunk
And we wanna hear some rock and roll
***
Is anybody listening? No
Where did that old feeling go?
***
Don't stop listening to rock and roll
***
Another round to the sound of that Mojo music
***
Muddy Waters said we got it so we might as well use it
***
I asked Katie to dance and I almost blew it
I only kissed her on the mouth 'cause he told me to do it
***
What does it take to be alive?
***
And all the chances we take
What we're measured by?
***
I sat on my couch and wondered why
It's such a beautiful day 
I'm still sitting inside
***
All I know is 
I'm still waiting for my sun to shine
***
Is this a waste of all my precious time?
And could this chance that I take lead me to losing my mind?
***
As I step to the edge, I saw the water below
Then I said to myself, "Sometimes you've got to let go"
***
All I know is
All I know is I'm still waiting for my sun to shine
***
Oh I see our clouds when I look around
Rain falls from my mouth as it hits the ground
***
Lead me to the light
'Cause I'm still waiting
I'm waiting for my sun to shine
***
What does it take to be a liar?
***
I was dancin' with the devil
I was singing dirty songs
***
Pouring whiskey from the bottle
'Till the early break of dawn
***
Oh my gorgeous Arizona
Here's to getting caught with you
***
I was running with the wolves
I was howling at the moon
***
I felt lonely, lost, and stranded
I felt down and torn apart
***
With no cash left in my pockets
Just a shitty fortune card
It read, 
"Strength will find you sooner than you ever thought it would"
***
Strength will find you sooner than you ever thought it would
***
Then the pain it turned to anger
Moved to joy so now I'm good
***
And I'm one pack of smokes from broke
I can tell I will make it alone
***
So I'll keep on fighting
Yeah I'll keep on fighting
In the end, when you sink, we float
***
I'm just one pack of smokes from broke
***
Yes I'm one pack of smokes from broke
***
Well where I come from
You learn to take it nice and slow
But baby since we met
Oh, it's been go, go, go
***
So you can rough me up
Yeah baby you can hurt me too
Because all I got
You see, all I got is you
***
You can rough me up
You can break me down
Baby don't stop now
***
Oh, you can use me up till it all runs out
Baby don't stop now
***
I'm all yours
I'm all yours somehow
Baby don't stop now
***
So where I come from
You learn to make the best of things
Honey since we met
You know you've had the best of me
***
So you can lock me up
Yeah baby throw away that key
Because all I know
Is that this is where I want to be
***
Got caught running up a tab
Couldn't drive home so I had to share a cab
***
Introduced herself by her last name
The kind of girl you steal from the football team
***
Brought up a silver spoon mess
Always trying to tear off her Catholic dress
***
Told me she's over this place
Needs to feel the midwest wind in her face
***
But the alcohol made its way down
She was the last thing that I saw last night before I hit the ground
***
Oh god I did the wrong thing to the right girl
My mind was only in it for a minute
***
Had a bad fling with a good girl
I was stupid and dumb for not giving up
***
The blank stare out the window
If I could just sober up I could just admit
I did the wrong thing to the right girl
***
It was your world, baby and I just lived in it
***
I've never been the best with my mouth
Try to stay smart but the dumb comes out
***
Maybe I'm shy, I drive an old car
Maybe I'm amazed that I got this far
***
And I got my stand-bys waiting on the line
But the hardest part is knowing that it won't be her this time
***
Please, please, baby come back
Please, please, baby come back
***
Thought she had it all planned out
Went to marry some guy she had talked about
***
A tear in her dress and a tear in her eye
And just like that her whole life flashed by
***
She won't remember what you said last night
That if you ever needed someone to pick up the pieces in your life
***
Photograph, remembering the summer
It takes me back
To Southern California
***
Where the girls would all pass
On the boardwalk and laugh
At our desperate attempts and our sunburned backs
We never had a chance, I remember that
***
And no matter what we do
We'll never lose what we had
Growing up, 
Won't bring us down.
***
Graduate, what's a kid to do now?
Get away
We've got so much to prove
***
Because it's time to move on
And I'm stuck to let go
But then Wonderwall comes on the radio
***
I flashback to the night in your parent's yard
When we drank too much and we talked about god
Growing up, 
Won't bring us down
***
We're in this together
Yeah, we'll make it somehow
Nothing's going to stop us now
Growing up won't bring us down
***
Photograph
Oh give me something to remember
***
I got your call
Now I'm here at your door
False alarm
Because you're not here anymore
***
I had it all in my head what I'd say to you
But you set me up again like you always do
***
The more you treat me cruel
Oh it just adds fuel to the fire 
***
Tease me like you do but it just fuels my desire 
***
You say you don't want me, I think you're a liar
Love or lust, it just adds fuel to the fire
Fuel to the fire
***
Sexy pics
You sent to me on my phone
And now I'm here
And I can't get you alone
***
I think I'm just beginning to understand
That you just like having the upper hand
***
I make you think you're the only one
But if we're not having fun
Then we're done
And who won?
***
I'm on a trip
I can't get off
Can't get over
***
I want it all
I want it all inside of you
***
I call you up
You're getting off
I'm coming over
***
You're 21
I see your eyes
You're barely sober
***
I hear your voice
I'm calling out
From me to you
***
I pour a drink
You move in quick
You're moving forward
***
Then you said, no
I'm never gonna be inside of you
And I said, no
I'm never gonna see inside of you
***
Because I know, I'm gonna fall
And you'll be waiting for it all
Because I know, I know, I know
I can't get inside of you
***
This fragile game
It's like a train, it's headed nowhere
***
It never stops
And I can't see the exit sign
***
We're headed north
I see the cliff we're getting closer
Look out baby
***
Don't say that you just wanna run away
Replay all the things I tried to say
I'm 21 so you're getting off
I'm coming over
***
Oh, it's safe to say I knew it
Yeah, I knew it all along
Asking the same questions
Singing the same songs
***
I've been gone for a while
Been traveling alone
Searching for a new life
When I already had my own
***
On every road
We cross alone
We're thinking of those we left back home
***
So follow the lines
And I'll be your guide
Because we're the lucky ones
On every road
***
Yeah, it's safe to say I knew
That all the selfish things I do
Would eventually come creeping back around
***
Way back when
You called me young
Said we're innocent and dumb
I knew that you'd come creeping back around again
***
We're too young
This is never gonna work
That's what they say
That you're gonna get hurt
But I know something they don't
***
I hear your heart
Beating right in time
Right from the start
I knew I had to make you mine
And now I'll never let you go
***
Don't they know that love won't lie?
***
Don't listen to the world
They say we're never gonna make it
***
Don't listen to your friends
They would have never let us start
***
Don't listen to the voices in your head
Listen to your heart
***
This promise
Doesn't have to be too loud
Just whisper
I could find you in a crowd
I think it's time we ran away
***
Your father
He says I'm not good enough, and
Your mother
She thinks that this is just a phase
I think that we should run away
***
It'll tell the truth
It'll set you free
It'll say that you were meant for me
And this is where we're supposed to be
***
Don't listen to the world
They say we're never gonna make it
But I know we'll make it
***
I walk the tight rope
On my way home
You're my backbone
I know you're somewhere close behind me
***
I walk the fault line
In a dirty field in the springtime
I feel the wind start to remind me
Of you
***
And the sweet talk
On the sidewalk
It's true
All know is
***
All we have is what's left today
Hearts so pure in this broken place
***
Because we are, we are, we are
Who we are, we are, we are
Lovers lost in space
We're searching for our saving grace
***
And I still remember
How your lips taste
On holidays
***
You leave in December
What can I do to make you stay?
***
Because we won't fade away
We'll find peace while other change
***
The way you're moving
Across the floor
Don't have to say it
You want some more
Give me some more
***
Give me what I want
Give me all you got
Give it to me
***
Tired of playing
I'm getting bored
No need to say it
I want some more
Give me some more, more, more
***
You got your daddy's wallet
And your mothers eyes
Soon enough girl you're going to realize
That when the pretty boys try to get next to you
They really just want to have sex with you
***
It's the way you move
And the clothes you wear
The alcohol and the way that you don't care
All I want to do is get next to you
Next to you, next to you
***
That sinful stare
Your poison kiss
Like Satan's daughter's holy lips
***
She said, "Let it slide"
All the things that I have running through my mind
Will all be gone in time
***
Remember son
All the things you've done
And all the things you lost
And all the things you've won
***
We're just trying to find some color in this
Black and white world
***
Tell me everything
Will be alright
***
Walk this way with me
Into the light
***
Because you can let it slide
Baby just for tonight
Just know that everyone feels broken sometimes
***
She said, "Take your time
Things will be just fine
Don't bite the hand that feeds
Because nothing is ever mine
***
And just wait your turn
And always try to learn
To love the ones that don't show love in return
***
When you're walking backwards
Don't be afraid to close your eyes
Because the truth is, darling
That everything will be alright
Alright?
***
Oh yeah, everyone feels cheated sometimes
Yeah we all feel a little fucked up sometimes
***
She takes her time with the little things
Love notes reminding me 
***
She wears red when she's feeling hot
I have her, but it's all I got
***
She looks best without her clothes
I know it's wrong but that's the way it goes
***
I don't know what she sees in me 
But I'm happy that she's happy now 
That she's with me
And I'm freaking out because I'm just so lucky
***
Oh, she makes me feel like shit 
(It's always something)
But I can't get over it 
(She thinks it's nothing)
***
'Cause she's everything I ask for
Everything I ask for
And just a little bit more
***
Everything I ask for
Everything I ask for and so much more
***
She loves music, but she hates my band
Loves Prince, she's his biggest fan
***
She's not big on holding hands
But that's alright 'cause I still got her
***
She keeps up on current affairs
Prada is what she wears
***
Fistfights turn into sex
I wonder what comes next
She loves to always keeps me guessing
***
And she (She) 
Won't (Won't) 
Give it up
***
I remember every night we spent on weekends
With good friends
We did nothing but it seems like we did so much
Back then
***
Oh back then we would kick it laughing all relaxing
And taking things for granted
We did anything for just that little rush
***
Just don't forget this
We won't regret this
We've got one chance to get it right
***
We're alive and we drive to the center of it
Where we know we're all fine and this just can't be it
***
And in the end we all know we only breathe for so long
So tonight's the night we all roll along
***
Oh back to our first cigarette
You know we can't forget all the faces that we've met
***
8123
Means everything to me
***
Take me back to the parking lots
The sleep we fought
And all the places we got caught
***
This place will always be part of me
Yeah you're all a part of me
***
I remember every day that I spent dreaming
Of leaving
This place behind I would run away from thinking
Adding up all the days spent wasted
Chasing the girls we hated
Some things, they, they never change
***
Take me back oh the sleepless nights
The stupid fights
It never mattered who was wrong or who was right
And now you're all a part of me
***
She's 18 and a beauty queen
She makes the boys feel so weak
***
It's all for her, not at all
She'll pick you up just to watch you fall
***
It's her hands on my hips, I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth and those lips, try not to taste 'em
***
That's just the way things are, 
and the way they'll always be
***
Girls do what they want
Whoa, whoa
Boys do what they can
***
She's 18 and a beauty queen
She's figured out all the boys like me
***
Head to toe you know she's dressed to kill
And she could the way she's looking at me
***
It's her face and those eyes, I can't escape 'em
It's that mouth and those lies, try not to taste 'em
***
Because the boys are feeling jealous
And it just doesn't make any sense
***
Go on and tell 'em why the girls are into fellas
That toss them to the side in the end
***
And you know that all the
The boys are falling in love
With the girls who don't know what's up
I think we've all had enough of this now
***
These kids are talking 'bout love
We think we've all had enough
We've had enough of this now
***
She thinks I'm crazy
Judging by the faces that she's making
***
And I think she's pretty
But pretty's just part of the things she does that amaze me
***
And she calls me sweetheart
I love it when she wakes me when it's still dark
***
And she watches the sun
But she's the only one I have my eyes on
***
Tell me that you love me
And it'll be alright
Are you thinking of me?
Just come with me tonight
***
You know I need you
Just like you need me
Can't stop, Won't stop
I must be dreaming
***
Can't stop, Won't stop
I must be dreaming
***
She moves in closer
Whispering to me "I thought I told ya"
***
And oh she's playing games now
And I figured it out now that we're
Now that we're closer
***
Two kids, one love
Who cares if we make it up
Her voice is sweet sound
Our clothes lay on the ground
***
Remember the day when we started this
And she made the shape of my heart with her hands
***
We try to make some sense of it
But she called me on the phone and said..
***
There was a new girl in town
She had it all figured out
(Had it all figured out)
***
And I'll state something rash
She had the most amazing...

Smile
I bet you didn't expect that
***
But she made me change my ways
With eyes like sunsets baby
And legs that went on for days
***
I'm fallin' in love
But it's fallin' apart
I need to find my way back to the start
***
When we were in love
Oh things were better than they are
***
Let me back into

Into your arms
***
She made her way to the bar
I tried to talk to her
But she seemed so far
Outta my league
I had to find a way to get her next to me
***
Oh she's slippin' away
I always freeze when I'm thinking of words to say
***
All the things she does
Make it seem like love
***
If it's just a game...

Then I like the way that we play
***
It's time to go, so put all your clothes on
I've got the keys, baby you're so gone
***
It's time to go, so put on all your clothes
We're running late, and we both know
***
'Cause you've got your plans, and you know that I have mine
I fade away, got so little time
***
So tonight, tonight, 
Let's fade away, let's fade away
Forget it all for just one day
***
Tonight, tonight, 
Oh baby we'll fade away
This is our time,
So baby it's time to
***
Get on the dance floor 
Pretend you know how
To make 'em all scream
Do what they're talking about
***
Just feel the music 
Fuck what they're saying
This is the moment 
That we've been waiting on
***
I'm taking, taking all of my time
I'm dodging words, but she's saying the right lines
***
She made me, made me oh so crazy
But this time I feel like I'm doing something right
***
It made me sick to think about
Everything you put me through and how you left without
(Saying goodbye)
***
And if it's really over now
Then you can walk away and it would be the last time
***
This is the end
Of you and me
***
Everything I used to be
Back then it meant something
But you're living a lie, you just can't hide from me
***
You had me hanging on your last word
And now I'm feeling a little less than trusting
***
You had me wishing we were something
But left me here with a whole lot of nothing now
***
Love is a luxury she said
I'd rather be in love than dead

But not with her, oh God not with her
She's the type of girl who makes love... hurt
***
I thought I had my girl but she ran away
My car got stolen and I'm gonna be late
For work this week, make that the fourth day straight
But I'm fine with it
(You don't have to worry)
***
I thought I had it all but I gave it away
I quit that old job now I'm doing okay
***
Those material things they can't get in my way
Cause I'm over it
***
But whatever she may be

She could be money, cars, fear of the dark
Your best friends or just strangers in bars
***
Whoever she is
Whoever she may be
One thing's for sure

You don't have to worry
***
And this is the part where you find out who you are
***
And these are your friends, those who've been there from the start
***
So to hell with the bad news
Dirt on your new shoes
It rained all of May 'til the month of June
***
And every day in every way oh she will look the same
And every care you used to have just seems to float away
***
To hell with your new shit
And whether or not you think you fit in
***
She could be rainy days, minimum wage
A book that ends with no last page
***
You count them one, two, three
You look so cute when you get that mad
***
You drain the life from me 
And it feels oh so good
***
The looks you give are so contagious

The way we move is so outrageous
***
Just let me in 
We're wasting time
Just let me in 
Let's make it look right
***
So stay up and get down
Sleep's just time spent wasting time
***
So get down, get down
Let's make it happen all night
***
You're moving close, my pulse is racing
We're getting close, yeah I can taste it
***
I've never done it quite like this
So slow it down now, just slow it down
***
Another party with the same kids
Another night with the same drinks
***
I need to find myself a new chick
I need to kiss a set of new lips
***
She's gotta be something new to me
A fresh face, someone new to please
***
So come on, come on girl, just you and me
Oh come on girl, just you and me
***
This kind of girl makes it rough 
Holding our breath while we touch
***
She won't kiss and tell, but this isn't how
She got that name, it all seems like a game
***
How she moves so well, I won't call this hell
If I had to guess, I'd say we have a mess you could sell
***
And how am I supposed to think
With her hands all over me
Telling me the right things
Ever so distracting
***
She's gotta be something new to me
Loose ends but no sight of strings
***
She's making it harder, harder to breathe
I'm getting weaker, but still pulling the strings
***
The lights are all off, there's no one around
We've both lost our minds, nowhere to be found
***
It's getting hot, I'm not saying this is hell
But I swear, this girl's a mess you could sell
***
Oh, you left me with a broken heart
And now I see what I should've from the start
***
Oh, you left me with nothing but a kiss
And now I'm leaving you with these lips

These lips
***
Everything looked fine from here
Everything looked more than clear
But now you are gone
And I'm still here
***
So check it out 
I wrote it down
In case you ever left us out
***
And baby you can't fire me
'Cause I quit right now
***
So now I'm pressing
But I ain't stressing
She's got a man
I'm with her best friend
***
Tried at love but it never really stuck
She said it's love but I didn't give a fuck
***
And now I'm better cause you left me
***
I just left 'cause you let me
***
Don't keep calling, just forget me
***
Surrounded by familiar faces 
The people that you love to see
Where everybody knows your name, and they're smiling
***
We may not be getting younger 
Our days might be slipping away
Yeah we're still so fucking young 
So we'll party like it's our last day
***
And for the first time, I feel less alone
***
And for the first time, I can call this home
***
It's our last time, to say goodnight
Don't say goodbye, cause in the morning we'll
We'll see you around
And we'll sing it again, same time tomorrow
Yeah we'll all join in
***
I'm ashamed of feeling down now
Cause we're the people we've been waiting on
***
All we needed was some good friends
And a song to sing a long
***
With voices yelling in the front room
No one could tell us keep it down
So we all just kept it loud 
And tried to wake the entire town
***
Oh these days are numbered, but we can't forget last summer
When we sang and threw our arms into the air
Go on and sing it out
***
Our days are numbered 
And we know we're not getting younger

But it's nights like these that make you not really care
***
We all have been degraded
We all have been the greatest
***
We all have been degraded
We all will be the greatest
***
I fell asleep last night
But I woke up too late
And everything I loved
I began to hate
***
I know I sound repetitive
'Cause I'm repeating myself
And I'm competitive
I want you all by yourself
And that alone is just the problem
I've got these woes
I just can't solve them
***
If I could gather up the nerve
I'd put my feelings into words
***
And if I weren't so young, or stupid, or restless
I might be able to just soon forget this
Just forget this
***
Please just forget me
When I'm out all alone on the east coast
And please don't forgive me
When you're home all alone and you need me most
***
Oh if I only had the heart
To find out exactly who you are
You know I'd try now
***
But it's just fine
No you can't save me
It's no fault but mine
Please just blame me
***
If I only had the heart, the nerve, the words
You'd think by now I would have learned
***
She's fresh to death
She'll be the death of you
Seduction leads to destruction
***
She's fresh to death
She'll be the death of me
She's fresh, she's but not so clean
***
Cute face slim waist
She's got them in a craze
Yeah we think he's going crazy
***
When she speaks it makes me grind my teeth
Yet he still thinks she's amazing
***
And she's been playing games
Ever since 98'
Shallow is as shallow does, yeah
Some people never change
***
And she's so fine
She thinks she's so damn fine
She might be fine
But she ain't worth a second of your time
***
You're as fake as the moans you make
And you're as weak as the hearts you break
***
You're as fake as the moans you make
So just give us, give us a little break
Come on and give me a break
***
Sex sells
And your sex cells make all the lost boys drool
***
Cause you're a dime
But they'll have to wait in line
Until one of them makes it two of you
***
Cute face slim waist
You've still got them in a craze
Yeah I think I'm going crazy
***
I have a long list of things to say
But I'll leave it at:
You amaze me
***
The boys they have their eyes all over you
And you're loving every second of attention
***
I need to find just some way to get through
Or at least some way that I can mention
***
I'm feeling you
You're feeling me
What exactly is holding us back?
***
I'm feeling you
Are you feeling me?
Just Give me something
Give me, give me, give me anything
***
Oh it's you
And it's true
You're electric I can't get over it
***
You're running through my veins you feel like a freight train
I'm trying everything to keep my hands off of you
***
So give me something
Please just give me anything
Because I want you more than they do
***
And oh no
I think I lost myself in your deep blue eyes
***
And oh no
I think it's time we cut to the chase tonight
***
I've been changing
You're still waiting on me
Just wait for me
***
And I am on my own
But it's nice to see you came along

And this might sound wrong
But I can only tell you through a song

And I will take my time
Cause it's the only thing that's on my side

And this can't be real
Tell me, do you ever feel
***
Do you ever feel?
Do you ever feel?
***
Oh I've been changing
You're still waiting on me
***
Never let go, never let go
She said I'll never grow up
***
Two years now since I met you
And I just can't forget about you
You don't know what you do to me
Oh you don't know what you're doing to me
***
And baby I'm not lost
I'm just a little confused on what to do
And it's all on me
Oh it's not you why can't you see?
***
Oh who are you now?
Oh who are you now?
***
This shit is so played out
It's so played out
***
Baby my ears are open
And I'm watching you
That language your body's speaking
It makes me sick
***
And you're not so smooth
Because you do it for the thrill
And I'm watching you
Yeah, I'm watching you
***
Because you're in love with love
You're not in love with him
***
And I can tell by the way you play it off
Like you don't know what you're doing to him
***
We've heard all about you
We know you're every move
Cause you're paper thin
And it's visible
***
And with or without you
He'll make it through
Cause you're paper thin
And it's visible
***
When I get the chance
To expose the truth
I'm gonna make my move
***
Because you're all two sides
And you're struggling
We won't let this slide
No, not this time
***
I want you
Just the way you are
I want you ooh ooh ooh
Just the way you are
***
Just come on back to bed
Stay with me
Oh no,you know it's true
I want you
Yeah
I want you 
***
I'll buy you rings
And shiny diamond things
Don't want nothing from you girl
Your love is all I need
***
Come on and dance a little closer now
Come on move a little slower now
Just take a chance
I ain't going to hurt you, child
I want you
***
Stay in bed
We'll work it out
Stay here forever
***
Worse or better
I'm leaving
No more laughter
I mean it
***
You're broken
I promise
I'll miss you
I'm sorry
***
Worse or better
I'm leaving
***
If I run away
I'll never look back
***
You can beg, you can cry
You can say you'll try
But I can't take that chance
***
I can't fool you no
You know me
Pushed me too hard
I'm shaking
***
You're talking
No walking
You tripped me
I'm falling
***
So long
Go on and waste my time
And don't
Don't ever cross that line
***
You'll never know
Unless you take it there
***
Go on and take your time
But don't
Don't ever leave my mind
***
You've been searching or something
That you never going find
Look ahead to tomorrow
Kiss yesterday goodbye
***
All the wants vs. needs
I've been there, please believe me
I hear something
You'll be singing "bye"
***
You've been walking with regret,
Like there's no hope for today
***
No, you can't paint it silver
And then still call it gold
But, you still paint it the same
***
Now honey don't believe him
Lord knows he's been deceiving
***
So if you're looking for some healing
Well baby
Look right my way
***
Oh a good man said
"If you're feeling dead
You got to try to find a way to be alive"
***
This is not a game
That you have to play
Don't need a reason to breathe
Just like you die
***
Give me thunder, give me lightning
And I will give you every part of me
***
Take me dancing, get me fucked up
Play that old guitar an we will sing
***
Oh my old man said
"You must lay in your bed
The way you make it, no one can make it like you do"
***
Oh you're not alone
You still have a home
No matter what you do, my son, I'm still proud of you
***
Hello world
Hello Sun
Man on the moon
Man on the run
***
It's taking town
It's moving slow
My whiskey's straight
Your whiskey cold
***
And I said
Hello world
***
Let's take a trip
You can come along
We'll take a sip
We'll sing a song
***
Tossing coins down the wishing well
Don't fall in now, it leads straight to Hell
***
I need you closer, need you beside me
Good Love will find me, Good Love will find me
***
The coffee's cold and it still works cold
So do the highs but you always end up alone
***
So no more lying
And no more fighting
***
I see the fire, it's almost blinding
Come out and find me, come out and find me
***
So fuck your coins and I wish you well
(Ahhh it feels good, don't it?)
***
Midnight comes in
Paris and as
I light my cigarette
The rain it hits my face
***
So I start walking
Toward the Ferris wheel
From my hotel on
Champs-Élysées
***
For now I am alone
I might always be alone
***
My heart is in the city of love
But it's raining in Paris
***
What good is a heart of gold
With nobody to share it with
***
It's coming down, it's coming down
My head can hardly bare it
***
So let it rain on me
See my heart's on fire
But I always got cold feet
***
Love never really did anything for me
Try telling that to this goddamn city
***
And if the storm should stop
I'd ask you to dance on some cliche mountain top
We'd share straws at your favorite coffee shop
But life it ain't no romance novel
***
I met a man
Who sold umbrellas and
Just five dollars
Saved me from all that rain
***
For now I am alone
I think I like being alone
***
This town 
It's a black hole
Sucking me in
Fucking me up
Yes, it does
***
I could just stay and keep praying
For things to get better
But they won't
***
And the only two things holding me here
Are whiskey and women
***
Oh, you're so naive
Just like a child
***
And I'll be happy
It just might take a while
Cause you can't make me smile
Oh, you can't make me smile
***
And I live in a room with no windows
Too much time on my hands
Too much shit in my head
Yes, there is
***
I do what I must to stay alive
Now I wanna feel it
But I will not bother building a pool
I'll never swim in
***
Thoughts fall 
Company and dreams As 
Friends I'm only half here
And the other half pretends
***
That I'm just
I'm just a bad haircut
Some fashion from last week
No one really knows me at all
***
But sometimes I like
Living in my own world
Disconnected and so naive
***
Perfectly out of key~
***
I'm not allowed to be anyone else
But me
So I try to take apart my head from time to time
***
And I'm not resolute so when I need help
Oh I will ask you and I will try to be polite
***
And sometimes I like living in my own world
Disconnected and so naive
I'm perfectly out of key
***
But the truth is I
I hate the truth
And I would rather live and die in fantasy
***
Last night I saw you in a dream
I'm still not sure as to what it all means
***
Two nights before much of the same
I found you dancing on the back of my brain
***
Hallucinating things are fine in my head
Illuminating the right side of my bed
***
And we kissed and we fought
I laughed and you screamed
I've learned to loathe these goddamn visions
But I just can't wait to fall back to sleep
***
Oh I woke up and I felt let down
You were tired of your silver hair and left this town
You're 300 something miles away
I close my eyes and all I see is your face
***
Ugly little feelings
Crawl inside my head

What's the point in leaving
This California king-sized bed?
***
What-if's
And the should-have's
They start to eat my brain
***
The shadow of my youth has
Made the sun go black again
***
I look around and I don't see the pretty things
The evil thoughts upstairs they don't need company
***
This broken glass it reflects back
The person I've become
***
And now
Here I am

I feel numb

On the fence

On the run

Spill my guts

What an act
I am sad
But to me I'm lovely sad
***
Imaginary numbers
Control the ones we love
Fooled by affectation
And something up above
***
If you're in love with diamonds
A simple death you're dying
A wasted life to me
***
Here we are all liars
Just hoping to get higher
Than everyone we meet
***
Huxley said we live together but we're always by ourselves
***
If you don't like this type of weather you can move to someplace else
***
Significance is rarely found underneath your couch
***
December first I'm in a foreign state
I'm running late, I'm all alone
Wishing I was home with you, baby
***She's got a way of making things okay
When she's not around, when she's not around
I'm going crazy
***We like to talk about the plans we make
And things we say when we're together
I hope for better weather this year
But you my dear, need to know
This year I want you alone
***Ho ho hopefully this holiday will make us believe that
We're exactly where we're supposed to be
***And we're ho ho hoping that
We all come back and as a matter of fact I know
We're exactly where we're supposed to be
Together by this Christmas tree
***We go together like the winter and this sweater
And she makes me feel, she makes me feel alive inside
***And when I look into her eyes, I see the blue and green
Like Christmas lights, like Christmas lights
Oh, what a sight
***She says I've got a way of making everything okay
She's not alone, she's not alone, and never will be
Ho ho hopefully this year I'll have you alone
***Don't you know this year I want you alone?
Baby I want you alone
***It’s Christmas day
I’m alone again
***She’s with him now
I’m with my loneliness
***She ran away 4 months ago
Left with his sleigh
For the north pole
***Santa, you bitch
Didn't get a damn thing from my Christmas list
All I got was this broken heart
***And that’s it
Santa, you bitch
Oh there’s only one thing that I truly wish
I wish my old girl would've never kissed Saint Nick
Would've never kissed Saint Nick
***I saw them dancing under mistletoe
Thought it was nothing but I guess I didn't know
That there was something going on with them
Santa, you player, I thought we were friends
***When you left she was a wreck
Cause she said you left a mess
(But you said that you'd be back home
Didn't wanna see her all alone)
***And you bet, she took your word
Cause she said you'll never learn
***All the things that you put her through
Don't know why she's coming back to you
***Oh she says she's alone
But she knows she's in love
***Mr. winter, did you miss her?
For the three months you were gone
Had her waiting all night long
***Mr. winter, don't forget her
She'll be waiting all alone
Please just say you'll come back
***And he's cold, but he keeps you warm
Cause his love, still burns for you
***And you don't know what's in store
But you both know what is true
***Snow falls in the quiet city
While a fire burns inside
***And I'm wrapped up in a feeling
Got you wrapped up in my mind
***All is calm, all is bright
And all I want is you tonight
***Twelve twenty-five
***I've got a list that's full of wishes
And every single one's for you
***And in the stillness took the list and crossed it, babe
You're the sleigh, the bells, the song on your side too
***Yeah all is calm, and all is bright
And all I want is you tonight
***Spring was everything in '17, now I'm just cold
***Summer fell to fall after all November froze
***Without you it's a season I ain't needing, I want to go come back home
***The reds and all the greens don't mean a thing when you're gone
***Winter means nothing
Yes, winter means nothing
***Winter means nothing to me now
Without you


Without you
***I'm having trouble sleeping like a child on Christmas Eve
***I'm restless in the night, like the lights upon the tree
***Yeah summer fell to fall, after all November's gone
